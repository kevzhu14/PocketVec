# PocketVec Repository 

**PocketVec** is a strategy to generate interpretable and fixed-length protein binding site descriptors based on the assumption that similar pockets bind similar ligands. The approach is built upon inverse virtual screening -the prioritization of a given set of small molecules is expected to be more correlated between a pair of similar pockets than between a pair of dissimilar ones. Further conceptual and methodological details are best described in the original PocketVec publication: REF.
