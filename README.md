# PocketVec Repository 

**PocketVec** is meant to generate protein binding site descriptors based on the assumption that similar pockets bind similar ligands. The approach is built upon inverse virtual screening: the prioritization of a predefined set of small molecules is expected to be more correlated between a pair of similar pockets than between a pair of dissimilar ones. Further conceptual and methodological details are best described in the original PocketVec publication: REF.


The **PocketVec Repository** holds the code needed to run PocketVec for any protein binding site of interest together with all results presented along the manuscript. The directory structure is specified as follows:

* `code`: funcions, scripts and .. to generate PocketVec descriptors. 
* `data`: 
* `examples`: 
* `results`:
